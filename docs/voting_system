= VOTING SYSTEM

The idea of the voting system is inspired by Reddit.

In our system, we will provide a voting API and a vote querying API
that can be integrated with our web-based front-end.

The benefit of such API is to provide a voting system where users
can show whether they agree / disagree on a topic/artical.
