= PASSWORD ENCRYPTION

The encryption strategy for user passwords can be illustrated as below:

  User        Frontend             Backend      Database
   |             |                    |            |
   o-(password)--o-(Base64)--<HTTP>---o-(SHA-256)--o-->

From the UI, users will enter the password in plain text format. This password
will be encrypted to a Base64 string using btoa() [1] function in JavaScript.

Then, the Base64 encrypted password will be sent through HTTP request to the
backend via POST method.

The encryption will continue on the backend side using rust-crypto crate [2],
using SHA-256 algorithm [3].

In the end of the encryption process, we will have the SHA-256 hash that we
will then use for user lookup or registration.
